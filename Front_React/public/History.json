Appropriate infant stimulation, such as music therapy, paired with physiological stabilization, enhances physiological and neurobehavioral development.\n\nThe immediate impact of music therapy on infant development may be related to its ability to reduce stress levels in infants.

However, I can provide general information about moderators of treatment success in music therapy with preterm infants.\n\nWhen considering treatment success in music therapy with preterm infants, there are several factors that can influence the outcomes. These may include:\n\n1. Gestational age: The gestational age at birth can impact an infant's developmental needs and response to music therapy. For example, extremely preterm infants may require a different approach compared to moderately preterm infants due to their specific developmental challenges.\n\n2. Duration and frequency of music therapy sessions: The duration and frequency of music therapy sessions can vary and may depend on the individual needs of the preterm infant. Consistency and regularity in the provision of music therapy sessions may have a positive impact on treatment outcomes.\n\n3. Parental involvement: The active involvement of parents in music therapy sessions can enhance the effectiveness of the intervention. When parents participate in the music therapy process, it can strengthen the parent-infant bond and promote positive developmental outcomes.\n\nThese factors can interact and influence the overall success of music therapy interventions with preterm infants. It's important to tailor the treatment approach to the specific needs of each individual preterm infant and consider these factors in the planning and implementation of music therapy sessions.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.

Several methodological approaches have been developed, including the NICU-MT model, the Creative Music Therapy (CMT) model, and the First Sounds: Rhythm, Breath and Lullaby (RBL) model.\n\nA systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving a music therapist found favorable effects of music therapy on infants' respiratory rate and decreased maternal anxiety. The review included 16 studies with a total of 1,071 infants and 286 parents. These studies compared music therapy combined with standard NICU care to standard care alone.\n\nNICU-MT interventions aim to attenuate potential developmental impairments in preterm infants and improve the quality of their hospitalization. Preterm birth disrupts the normal development of the fetus, and the NICU environment, with its chaotic and disorganized sounds, can be potentially noxious for the infants' development. Music therapy can help support the neonates in their physiological and behavioral self-regulation and assist parents in coping with their infant's hospitalization.\n\nMusic therapy in the NICU can be delivered through live music and singing, recorded music, the mother's voice, intrauterine sounds, or a combination with tactile, vestibular, or vibro-tactile stimulation. The studies have shown positive effects of music therapy and music or auditory stimulation on infants' behavioral states, reduction of crying episodes, improved oxygen saturation, heart rate, and respiratory rate, as well as shorter hospital stays and improved weight gain.\n\nBased on this information, it can be concluded that NICU-MT training is effective in supporting the development, well-being, and bonding process of preterm infants and their parents.

These findings suggest that NICU-MT training can be effective in stabilizing the physiological states of premature infants and improving the well-being of their caregivers. The use of live contingent or infant-directed singing with lullabies, parents' preferred songs, and improvised singing has been highlighted as particularly beneficial in improving mother-infant interaction and bonding.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while there is evidence supporting the effectiveness of music therapy in the NICU, there is no agreed standard protocol for music therapy or music interventions in this setting.
