[[{"query": "what is music therapy?", "answer": "Music therapy is a form of therapy that uses music to address emotional, physical, cognitive, and social needs of individuals. It involves the use of musical interventions, such as listening to music, playing instruments, singing, and improvising, to promote healing, relaxation, self-expression, and communication.", "sources": {"Lorch, A.O., et al. 1994.

The results showed a significant decrease in heart rate during both live and recorded lullabies sessions compared to the control condition. Although there was no significant difference between live and recorded lullabies in terms of heart rate, live lullabies had an earlier beneficial impact on heart rate than recorded lullabies. \n\nIt is important to note that the study did not specifically compare different music therapy techniques to change heart rate in preterm infants. Therefore, the most effective music therapy technique to change heart rate in preterm infants cannot be determined based on the provided information. \n\nHowever, it is worth mentioning that music therapy has been shown to have various positive effects on preterm infants, including improving oxygen saturation levels, respiratory rate, and behavior. It is also believed that relaxing music may promote a more balanced regulation of the heart rate by influencing the autonomic nervous system. \n\nOverall, while the specific music therapy technique to change heart rate in preterm infants is not known, music therapy in general has shown promising results in improving physiological responses in preterm infants.", "sources": {"Caparros Gonzalez, 2017,Listening to Relaxing Music Improves Physiological Responses in Premature Infants": [7], "Garunkstiene et al. 2014.

The research suggests that live as well as recorded lullabies have a beneficial effect on the heart rate and behavioral state of preterm infants. The heart rate of the infants significantly decreased during live and recorded lullaby sessions compared to the control condition. Live lullabies also had a deeper impact on the infants' sleep.\n\nSleep is important for the maturity and weight gain of preterm infants, and the results of the study indicate that music therapy can contribute to improving sleep and state regulation in these infants. This is important for their overall health and well-being.\n\nWhile the study did not find a significant influence of music therapy on oxygen saturation levels in preterm infants, it is important to note that this may be due to the specific characteristics of the infants in the study who were not receiving oxygen therapy.\n\nMusic therapy has been found to be safe for very low birth weight infants and can provide positive experiences for healthy neurological development. Appropriate infant stimulation, such as music therapy, paired with physiological stabilization, enhances physiological and neurobehavioral development.\n\nThe immediate impact of music therapy on infant development may be related to its ability to reduce stress levels in infants. Music has been shown to reduce the release of the stress hormone cortisol in adults and children, and it is possible that it has a similar effect on premature infants.\n\nThe study also suggests that female infants may benefit more from music therapy than male infants, although the specific reasons for this gender difference are not yet understood.\n\nOverall, music therapy can have immediate and long-term benefits for the neurodevelopment of preterm infants.

Please order according to effect size", "answer": "I don't have access to the support information that you provided, so I cannot extract the relevant details to answer your question about the three most important moderators of treatment success of music therapy with preterm infants. However, I can provide general information about moderators of treatment success in music therapy with preterm infants.\n\nWhen considering treatment success in music therapy with preterm infants, there are several factors that can influence the outcomes. These may include:\n\n1. Gestational age: The gestational age at birth can impact an infant's developmental needs and response to music therapy. For example, extremely preterm infants may require a different approach compared to moderately preterm infants due to their specific developmental challenges.\n\n2. Duration and frequency of music therapy sessions: The duration and frequency of music therapy sessions can vary and may depend on the individual needs of the preterm infant. Consistency and regularity in the provision of music therapy sessions may have a positive impact on treatment outcomes.\n\n3. Parental involvement: The active involvement of parents in music therapy sessions can enhance the effectiveness of the intervention. When parents participate in the music therapy process, it can strengthen the parent-infant bond and promote positive developmental outcomes.\n\nThese factors can interact and influence the overall success of music therapy interventions with preterm infants. It's important to tailor the treatment approach to the specific needs of each individual preterm infant and consider these factors in the planning and implementation of music therapy sessions.\n\nI hope this information is helpful.
